# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May13 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've Learnt What is Greedy Algorithm is by solving a problem On Leetcode.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding on DS and Algo. Should start learning Algoritms deep and stop using discuss section gradually.

### Day 2: May14 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've Learnt Trie Data Structure. Solved todays leetcode challange ( Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)).

**Thoughts** Should learn maximum implementations of this Data Structure.

### Day 3: May15 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've started Arrays. Solved Pascals Traingle based problems.

**Thoughts** started solving Leetcode starting with simple data structors and I will be gradually go to complex DS. I'll do this evry day by day besides solving evryday Leetcode challange.
